New day, new blog. Whoever you are, if you read this, I bid you welcome. 

I am always looking for cute new systems, tricks, tips and techniques to create cool stuff. Fractals, reaction diffusion, raytracing, cellular automata, procedural graphics, etc. This blog is kind of an exploration of that. I will be posting tutorials, mainly for the purpose of passing on my knowledge, but also a big reason is just to solidify the knowledge in my own mind. To be able to teach, one must truly know the subject, and in putting together tutorials, it will highlight gaps in my knowledge and areas of unclarity in my mind.

I really hope you can learn something in these pages, even if it is just a tiny, obscure part of programming or graphics.. If you have any suggestions or critiques, I am always open to improvement.

Thanks, and have a very lovely day.
